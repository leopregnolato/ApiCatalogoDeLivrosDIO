# Books Catalog API for Digital Inovvation One

This project is based on _ApiCatalogoJogos_ made for [Thiago Oliveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-campos-de-oliveira-693a3840/) Digital Innovation One instructor.

The main project's objective was build a simple API REST for a CRUD solution. Here I adapted the API from Series Repository to Books Repositoy. I changed two main object attributes what I included  _Autor_ and _Editora_ (Author and Publisher) intead of only _Produtora_'s attribute from Serie object in first API.

The UML diagram for the API is shown below:
